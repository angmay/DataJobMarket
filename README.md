With the rapid advancement of technologies, data related jobs have become highly demanded in recent years. 
The computer technology boom in the past 20 years has made computer usage much easier and cheaper for everyone, 
and this has led to the enormous increase in data generation and the demand for data organization. With an easier access to data, 
and the importance of data in decision making, data analysis has become significantly crucial in all industries. 

----

This project focuses on the current job market for data related jobs in four different countries: 
The ``United States (US)``, ``Canada``, ``Australia``, and ``Singapore``. Using the **Extraction**, **Loading**, **Transformation** (ETL) methodology, 
the project will extract all data related job postings from Indeed in these four countries, transform them, and load them into an SQL database.
The project scope will include data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, and machine learning roles. Furthermore, 
this project also used the same ETL process to obtain the worldâ€™s university ranking data and mental health survey for further analysis on any possible relationships.
